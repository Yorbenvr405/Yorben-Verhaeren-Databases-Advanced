In this text file you will see an Q&A about how that I try to use Docker.

What things are finnished in docker?

    - I made a container for redis. I used this command in Windows CMD terminal: docker run --name some-redis -d redis
    - In this container I can run the command: redis-server --port 6380 to start up the redis server

Why is it handy to hova a docker container?
