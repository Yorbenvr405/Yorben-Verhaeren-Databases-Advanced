In this text file you will see an Q&A about how that I tried to use Docker.

What things are finnished in my docker?
    - I made a container for redis. I used this command in Windows CMD terminal: docker run --name some-redis -d redis.
    - In this container I can run the command: redis-server --port 6380 to start up the redis server.
    - After that I searched for how to implemend Docker in my scraper. I got stuck with the ports and other things.
    But I found handy websites online that helped me a little for understanding what I was doing wrong.
    You can find all the websites that I found in this documents here under or in this github page under wiki.

Why is it handy to have a docker container?
    - Docker is a container based programm and its lets you isolate softwere components into independent enviroments with their own filesystem.
    - It is lighter vitual machine with linux for your pc or compouter to run.
