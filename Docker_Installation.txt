In this text file you will see an Q&A about how that I tried to use Docker.

What things are finished in my docker?
    - I made a container for redis. I used this command in Windows CMD terminal: docker run --name some-redis -d redis.
    - In this container I can run the command: redis-server --port 6380 to start up the redis server.
    - After that I searched for how to implement Docker in my scraper. I got stuck with the ports and other things.
    But there are handy websites online that helped me.
    You can find all the websites in this documents here under or in this github page under wiki.

Why is it handy to have a docker container?
    - Docker is a container based program and its lets you isolate software components into independent environments with their own filesystem.
    - It is lighter virtual machine with Linux for your pc or computer to run.
